The LGT8FX8P is a small Chinese microcontroller, more or less a cheap clone of the ATmega328 MCU used in Ex. Arduino UNO. 
This controller is, in my view, interesting for two reasons; 
1. It's cheep, less than 1 USD a piece. 
2. it's capable, Ex. having the abillity to clock faster than the AVR counterpart and including a simple on-chip DAC.

There's obvious things that are different, and there's the language barrier ... I can't speak for you folks, but I for one are not able to read Chinese manuals or even poorly translated ("Chinglesh") versions of them.
So I saw no other options and had to translate it myself ... 

The good news is that it's actually possible to translate such a paper without prior knowledge of Chinese, but it require using Google Translate intelligently.
A lot of work, true, but in the end it makes for a much better document to read from.

Note:
1. The company Logic Green owns all IP rights for this translation. I haven't asked for any permission to do this translation, so consequently I don't own any IP in regard to this effort.
2. I consider a mere translation of this content to be what's legally referred to as "fair use", as long as it's done non-profit as a community effort, and not trying to claim ownership to any IP.
3. This translation is not finalized, meaning it is usable but still need proofreading. I'll upload whatever I do myself, whenever I get around to it, but for now I'm not persuing this task.
4. Any contribution with proposed changes or corrections of errors will be gratefully received. Proofreading such a large document is, in the end, a lot of work.
