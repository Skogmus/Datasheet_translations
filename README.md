# Datasheet_translations
A public way of sharing what documentation I've initially translated for my own sake.

I whose a GIT-repo over Google Drive or Dropbox, because GIT invites to collaboration. Anyone are welcome to join in to improve on these translations, or even adding some new ones if that's opertune. I'll try to keep up, but please be kind; I've used CVS and Subversion for decades, but never actually set out to manage a GIT-repo before. If you see you can guide or help me, please do :)

All my translations are made in LibreOffice Write. I'm thinking this should be ok for most of us, since it's free as in both speech & beer, and it is quite good at exporting documents to properly indexed pdfs. So in this repo you'll find these documents as both *.odt and *.pdf, where the pdf's are ment for download.

Now, let's try this for size!
